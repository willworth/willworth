Hello, Internet.

I'm a full-stack developer with 6 years of experience at Accenture, currently transitioning toward AI-enhanced development and cloud architecture. I work primarily with React, TypeScript, and Node.js, and I'm expanding into Golang and AWS infrastructure.

Current focus:

Learning AWS CDK and Infrastructure as Code.
Exploring AI-assisted development workflows and automation tools like n8n.
Building toward solutions architecture and technical leadership roles.
Studying for AWS Solutions Architect certification.

Background:

Led a 10-person frontend team
Deployed production applications across AWS, GCP, and Azure.
Native English speaker, fluent in Spanish - working remotely from Spain.
Experience with monorepo architecture, CI/CD, and modern deployment practices.

What I'm building:

Personal platform using Next.js, Turborepo, and AWS CDK.
Projects demonstrating full-stack capabilities with modern infrastructure.
Learning in public about AI tools, cloud architecture, and career transitions.

I'm interested in roles that value broad technical experience, bilingual communication, and the ability to ship real systems. Open to senior developer, technical lead, or consulting positions with remote EU/UK/US companies.
También hablo español. Let's build something.
